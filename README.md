# transform-composer

This is a project that serves for me an educational/exploratory purpose.

Final goal is to have a visual tool that allows me to define and compose transforms of various kinds and apply them to an image.

Here comes the educational/exploratory part. Along the way I'll be creating an application framework and not use an existing one. I've always wanted to try my hand at that and thus imrpove my general understanding of general application design.
